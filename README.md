# k-Motiflets

Intuitively speaking, k-Motiflets are the set of the exactly k most similar subsequences.

$k$-Motiflets are a novel definition for MD that turns the problem upside-down. $k$-Motiflets take the desired motif set size $k$ as parameter and maximize the similarity of the motif set. This $k$ is an integer with an easily understood interpretation, and in many use cases the expected size of the motif set is known prior to the analysis. Consider for example the possible copyright fraud in the pop song Ice ‚ÄúIce Baby‚Äù by Vanilla Ice compared to ‚ÄúUnder pressure‚Äù by Queen / David Bowie. Listening to these songs it is easy to obtain an initial guess of the number of repetitions (parameter $k$) of the problematic sections. On the other hand, it is impossible for humans to guess a good value for the numerical, real-valued distance between the different repetitions (parameter r). 

We argue that guessing k is almost always easier, as the concept of *how many repetitions of a motif do you expect* is easy to understand - though the guess itself need not be easy and thus we will also offer algorithms to learn $k$. Furthermore, as $k$ is an integer, there is only a very limited number of options, as use cases with thousands of motif occurrences are rare. In contrast, the concept of *how far apart do you expect motifs to be at maximum* is extremely difficult to understand as distances (far apart) are measured by an opaque mathematical formula for which no intuition exists. Furthermore, $r$ is a real value with infinitely many values, and even small changes may lead to gross changes in the motif found. 

# Showcase

The following video highlights the ease of use of $k$-Motiflets using an ECG recording from the Long Term Atrial Fibrillation (LTAF) database.

**In essence, there is no need for tuning any real-valued similarity threshold via trial-and-error, as is the case for virtually all motif set competitors. 
Instead, for $k$-Motiflets we may either directly set the maximal number of repetitions $k$ of a motif, or simply learn this value from the data.**

# Usage

Here we illustrate how to use k-Motiflets. 

The following TS is an ECG from the Long Term Atrial Fibrillation (LTAF) database, which 
is often used for demonstrations in motif discovery (MD). The problem is particularly 
difficult for MD as actually two motifs exists: The first half of the TS contains a 
rectangular calibration signal with 6 occurrences, and the second half shows ECG 
heartbeats with 16 to 17 occurrences.

The major challenges in motif discovery are to learn the length of interesting motifs
and to find the largest set of the same motif, i.e. all repetitions.

# Learning the motif length `l`

We first extract meaningful **motif lengths (l)** from this use case:

```
# The Motiflets-class
ml = Motiflets(
    ds_name,     # the name of the series
    series,      # the data
    df_gt        # ground truth, if available
)

k_max = 20
length_range = np.arange(25,200,25) 
motif_length = ml.fit_motif_length(ks, length_range)
```
<img src="https://github.com/patrickzib/motiflets/raw/main/images/plot_au_ef.png" width="300">

The plot shows that meaningful motifs are within a range of 0.8s to 1s, equal
to roughly a heartbeat rate of 60-80 bpm.

# Learning the motif size `k`

To extract meaningful **motif sizes (k)** from this use case, we run 

```
dists, candidates, elbow_points = ml.fit_k_elbow(
    ks,
    motif_length    
)
```

The variable `elbow_points` holds characteristic motif sizes found.  
Elbow points represent meaningful motif sizes. Here, $6$ and $16$ are elbows, which are 
the 6 calibration waves and the 16 heartbeats.

We finally plot these motifs:

The first repetitions perfectly match the calibration signal (orange), while the latter 16 
repetitions perfectly match the ECG waves (green).
